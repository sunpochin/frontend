## JS

1. What is the difference between == and ===?
    - Doubles equals checks for value only. Before checking, it does any necessary type coercion. For example, the string "1" will be == to the integer 1, but it will not be ===. Many projects these days prefer to always use ===. Although, some folks advocate writing code that works well with the == type coercion.
