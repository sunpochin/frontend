A List Of All CSS Selectors [Day 8]
Thus far, we already learned about a lot of key CSS selectors. Here's a list / summary of all the CSS selectors that you can use in CSS (including some, which we haven't seen yet):

Tag type selector

CSS: p { ... }

Would select this HTML element for example: <p>Some text...</p>

This selector selects all HTML elements that are of this tag type

ID selector

CSS: #some-id { ... }

Would select this HTML element for example: <h1 id="some-id">...</h1>

This selectors selects the element that has this ID on it (should only be once per page)

Class selector

CSS: .some-class { ... }

Would select this HTML element for example: <h1 class="some-class">...</h1>

This selector selects all HTML elements that have this class on them

Attribute selector (new)

CSS: [src] { ... }

Would select this HTML element for example: <img src="...">

This selector selects all elements that have this HTML attribute on them

Universal selector (new)

CSS: * { ... }

Would select this HTML element for example: <p>....</p><img ...>

This selector selects ALL HTML elements (directly, not through inheritance but as if you would target them all individually)

Grouping selector / selector list

CSS: p, .some-class { ... }

Would select this HTML element for example: <p>...</p><h2 class="some-class">...</h2>

This selector selects all elements that match the individual selectors in that list

Combined selector

CSS: p.some-class { ... }

Would select this HTML element for example: <p class="some-class">...</p>

This selector selects all elements that meet both conditions (i.e. "<p>" elements with "some-class" class on it, in this example)

Pseudo selector

CSS: a:hover { ... }

Would select this HTML element for example: <a>...</a> (when the user hovers over it)

This selector selects all elements that meet this "pseudo state" (i.e. all links that are hovered in this example)
